### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub. I am very enthusiastic of data and AI and I hope you are too :smiley:. A bit of my background: I have extensive research work experience in mathematical physics aka string theory :astonished:. Luckily, I had the opportunity to work with some of the brilliant minds in this field. Data has become my new passion and now I look at the numbers from a whole new perspective (before, they were just symbols). 

Here you can find several machine learning projects designed from scratch ranging from classic algorithms such as decision trees or boosting to more complex models like convolutional nets and attention models. I enjoy learning and developing new models so I constantly upload new stuff here.
