### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub. I am a big enthusiastic of data and AI and I hope you are too :smiley:. A bit of my background: in the past I did extensive research work in mathematical physics aka string theory :astonished:. Luckily, I had the opportunity to work with some of the brilliant minds in this field. Data has become my new passion and now I look at the numbers from a whole new perspective (before they were just symbols). 

Here you can find several machine learning projects designed from scratch ranging from classic algorithms such as decision trees or boosting but also more complex models such as convolutional nets or attention models. I enjoy learning and developing new models so I am constantly uploading new stuff here.
